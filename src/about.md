    "<span class=\"text-2xl font-bold\">I'm Gears; a programmer, Minecraft enthusiast, YouTuber and nerd.</span><br/><br/>
    The programming language I know most about, and therefore use the most, is JavaScript/TypeScript. However, I also know Ruby, MCFunction and Golang, and dabble in Rust and Python.<br/>
    I make <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@Gearsdatapacks\" class=\"text-blue-500 underline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTube videos</a> about my ongoing struggle with Minecraft datapacks, as well as other fun Minecraft content.<br/>
    Projects I've made include a programming language with Minecraft datapacks (not alone), and a Datapack Package Manager.<br/>
    More information on the <a href=\"/projects/\" class=\"font-bold hover:underline\">projects</a> page."
